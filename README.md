What is BusterBox?

This one of my project. I was trying to learn git at that time so only one of the initial commit was done this is incomplete and final version was lost after hardisk crash. build a software using javafx and python which can recommend movies, TV show, and more based on a person's liking history. This was a test program to start my college project which was in node, python and react.
